\defgroup mt4orders MT4Orders Compatibility Layer
\brief Emulation of MetaTrader 4 order functions for MQL5.

This module provides a compatibility layer that implements commonly used MT4 order-handling
functions inside MQL5, simplifying the process of migrating MQL4 codebases to MetaTrader 5.

The implementation is fully written in MQL5 and wraps standard classes such as `CTrade` and `COrderInfo`,
but exposes an MT4-like API for order placement, modification, selection, and closing.

### Emulated Functions:
- OrderSend
- OrderClose
- OrderModify
- OrderDelete
- OrderSelect
- OrderType
- OrderLots
- OrderMagicNumber
- OrdersTotal
- OrderTicket
- OrderProfit
- OrderOpenTime
- OrderOpenPrice
- OrderStopLoss
- OrderTakeProfit

### Example Usage:
```cpp
#include <MT4Orders.mqh>

int ticket = OrderSend(Symbol(), OP_SELL, 0.2, Bid, 3, 0, 0, "Sell Test", 42, 0, clrRed);
if (ticket >= 0 && OrderSelect(ticket, SELECT_BY_TICKET))
{
    Print("Order opened with magic = ", OrderMagicNumber());
}
```

### Notes:
- Only one order can be selected at a time (like in MT4)
- Uses global state internally â€” avoid using in multithreaded contexts
- Suitable for porting older MT4 EAs to MQL5 with minimal changes
